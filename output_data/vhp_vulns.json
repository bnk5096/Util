This character causes the neutral characters (numbers and punctuation) preceding it to take on the RTL direction, while http://example.com remains LTR.  As a result, the URL is displayed as http://example.com/\u202d\u0627/127.0.0.1, with the LTR segment appearing before the RTL segment.\nThe displayed URL is an example of address bar spoofing because it leads the user to believe they are visiting example.com, when they are actually navigating to localhost.

vulnerability is likely due to extraneous \nmemory buffers being unintentionally read. As a result, an attacker could \ntheoretically craft a special stream of data to be decoded by the DPCM decoder, \nand have that data contain a pointer that executes undesired code. \nThe same concept could also be used to create a denial of service attack. \nThis vulnerability is similar to that of a buffer overflow.

When looking through the commits \nand repository, there was no information regarding the failure that was observed. By \nobveserving the vulnerability, it is assumed that an attacker could potentially enter a\nmalicious input causing a buffer overflow.\n"}, {"id": 1656, "cve": "CVE-2012-2782", "announced":

If it could not,\nwrite_wakeup() would get a null pointer dereference exception and the system\nwould crash.\n"}, {"id": 3675, "cve": "CVE-2020-15436", "announced": "2020-11-23T00:00:00.000Z", "upvotes": 0, "nickname": "", "project_name": "Linux Kernel", "subdomain": "kernel", "tag_json": [{"id": 35, "importance": 1}, {"id": 256, "importance": 0.8}, {"id": 269, "importance": 0.7}, {"id": 268, "importance": 0.7}, {"id": 258, "importance": 0.7}, {"id": 249, "importance": 0.5}, {"id": 257, "importance": 0.3}, {"id": 270, "importance": 0.2}, {"id": 259, "importance": 0.1}, {"id": 622, "importance": 0}], "description": ""}, {"id": 3676, "cve": "CVE-2020-15437", "announced": "2020-11-23T00:00:00.000Z", "upvotes": 0, "nickname": "", "project_name": "Linux Kernel", "subdomain": "kernel", "tag_json": [{"id": 26, "importance": 1}, {"id": 256, "importance": 0.8}, {"id": 268, "importance": 0.7}, {"id": 249, "importance": 0.5}, {"id": 257, "importance": 0.3}, {"id": 270, "importance": 0.2}, {"id": 259, "importance": 0.1}, {"id": 622, "importance": 0}], "description": ""}, {"id": 3678, "cve": "CVE-2020-15802", "announced": "2020-09-11T00:00:00.000Z", "upvotes": 0, "nickname": "", "project_name": "Linux Kernel", "subdomain": "kernel", "tag_json": [{"id": 118, "importance": 1}, {"id": 256, "importance": 0.8}, {"id": 258, "importance": 0.7}, {"id": 255, "importance": 0.6}, {"id": 248, "importance": 0.5}, {"id": 257, "importance": 0.3}, {"id": 254, "importance": 0.1}, {"id": 622, "importance": 0}], "description": ""}, {"id": 3679, "cve": "CVE-2020-15852", "announced": "2020-07-20T00:00:00.000Z", "upvotes": 0, "nickname": "i/o 88", "project_name": "Linux Kernel", "subdomain": "kernel", "tag_json": [{"id": 11, "importance": 2.311431302993263}, {"id": 77, "importance": 1}, {"id": 256, "importance": 0.8}, {"id": 258, "importance": 0.7}, {"id": 269, "importance": 0.7}, {"id": 268, "importance": 0.7}, {"id": 249, "importance": 0.5}, {"id": 295, "importance": 0.5}, {"id": 287, "importance": 0.5}, {"id": 288, "importance": 0.5}, {"id": 603, "importance": 0.35}, {"id": 257, "importance": 0.3}, {"id": 277, "importance": 0.27}, {"id": 605, "importance": 0.25}, {"id": 260, "importance": 0.2}, {"id": 259, "importance": 0.1}, {"id": 613, "importance": 0}, {"id": 622, "importance": 0}, {"id": 516, "importance": 0}, {"id": 3, "importance": 0}, {"id": 2, "importance": 0}, {"id": 508, "importance": 0}, {"id": 281, "importance": 0}, {"id": 517, "importance": 0}, {"id": 519, "importance": 0}, {"id": 518, "importance": 0}, {"id": 610, "importance": 0}], "description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel that allows an attacker to be granted the I/O port permissions of an unrelated task.

In the IPv6\nsystem there is a limitation on size of a network packet.  When a packet gets too\nlarge, it is fragmented into smaller packets.  To keep them from becoming separated,\nthe packets are given a matching ID.  In the past, this ID incremented by one\neverytime this happened, meaning that one could count the exact number of packets\nhandled in between two fragments.  This was considered a security leak, so the Linux\nkernel added a more sophisticated mechanism.  It stored the IP address in a hash\ntable, and stored an incrementing counter at that key.  Whenever a packet ID was\nneeded, it would add a random number to the counter and use the result as the ID.  To\nmake this more unpredictable, a change was made so that this random number was\nbased on the number of milliseconds since the time of last access at that IP hash.\nHowever, as with any hash table, collisions could be forced.  Using these and seeing\nwhat fragment IDs were generated, attackers were able to read secret messages\ntransmitted from computers that were supposed to be on a secure network.  The internal\nstate of the counter was enough to exfiltrate secret information over a network,\nusing the state of the server as a message box.  The mechanism of the exploit was\nsimple, to signal a 1, the locked down computer would send a large number of packets\nover an interval, causing this counter to increment greatly.  To signal a 0, it\nwould send no packets, causing the counter to remain the same.  When a computer on\nthe outside (colliding with the internal computer's IP address) tried to get a new\npacket ID, it would see how much it had changed by since it last sent a packet,\nindicating if a 1 or 0 was intended.  To resolve this issue as well as similar collision\nissues, the Linux kernel developers replaced any internal state here with a random\nnumber, ensuring that the packet ID is truly random.  At first, they just increased\nthe size of the internal hash table to make finding collisions harder, but since\nIPv6 addresses are so easily available in large numbers, they also decided on the\nrandom mechanism to take any precictability out of packet IDs.\n"}, {"id": 4022, "cve": "CVE-2022-0001", "announced": "2022-03-11T00:00:00.000Z", "upvotes": 0, "nickname": "", "project_name":

If this is done, the sanitization of the\ninput becomes very complicated and hard to determine what should actually be sanitized\nbecause the precise sanitization depends on the project.\nAlthough it is hard to find an example of the type of injection used in this vulerability,\nit has to do with the underlying ANTLR framework.\nOGNL is a very exploitable language if it is not used carefully, and it even played\ninto the equifax breach (CVE-2017-5638).\n"}, {"id": 4600, "cve": "CVE-2016-3093", "announced": "2016-05-31T00:00:00.000Z", "upvotes": 0, "nickname": "", "project_name": "Struts", "subdomain": "struts", "tag_json": [{"id": 11, "importance": 2.264559425581656}, {"id": 299, "importance": 0.45}, {"id": 299, "importance": 0.45}, {"id": 605, "importance": 0.25}, {"id": 284, "importance": 0}, {"id": 2, "importance": 0}, {"id": 623, "importance": 0}], "description": ""}, {"id": 4601, "cve": "CVE-2016-4003", "announced": "2016-04-12T00:00:00.000Z", "upvotes": 0, "nickname": "", "project_name": "Struts", "subdomain": "struts", "tag_json": [{"id": 623, "importance": 0}], "description": ""}, {"id": 4603, "cve": "CVE-2016-4431", "announced": "2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z", "upvotes": 0, "nickname": "", "project_name": "Struts", "subdomain": "struts", "tag_json": [{"id": 623, "importance": 0}], "description": ""}, {"id": 4605, "cve": "CVE-2016-4436", "announced": "2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z", "upvotes": 0, "nickname": "", "project_name": "Struts", "subdomain": "struts", "tag_json": [{"id": 299, "importance": 0.45}, {"id": 299, "importance": 0.45}, {"id": 2, "importance": 0}, {"id": 284, "importance": 0}, {"id": 623, "importance": 0}], "description": ""}, {"id": 4607, "cve": "CVE-2016-4461", "announced": "2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z", "upvotes": 0, "nickname": "Forced Double OGNL Evaluation", "project_name": "Struts", "subdomain": "struts", "tag_json": [{"id": 11, "importance": 2.195198623555008}, {"id": 23, "importance": 1}, {"id": 295, "importance": 0.5}, {"id": 287, "importance": 0.5}, {"id": 291, "importance": 0.5}, {"id": 297, "importance": 0.5}, {"id": 289, "importance": 0.5}, {"id": 298, "importance": 0.45}, {"id": 299, "importance": 0.45}, {"id": 299, "importance": 0.45}, {"id": 604, "importance": 0.35}, {"id": 277, "importance": 0.27}, {"id": 605, "importance": 0.25}, {"id": 623, "importance": 0}, {"id": 2, "importance": 0}, {"id": 284, "importance": 0}, {"id": 558, "importance": 0}, {"id": 3, "importance": 0}], "description": "This vulnerability stems from improper input validation within Apache Struts\nin relation to OGNL, more formally known as Object Graph Navigation Language.\nOGNL is an expression language used to access and mutate Java Object properties,\nas well as interact with other forms of metadata.\nIn this instance, OGNL's expression evaluation operator \"%{}\" can be used to force\ndouble evaluation of a Struts data object attribute.

Sensitive data may be compromised due to the inadequate or inconsistent verification of identities. In relation to Tomcat, Tomcat encrypts data along a communication channel between two parties. Tomcat supports renegotiation, which allows the user to interact with a system before authentication, then change their status to an authenticated user while also saving the user's activity, data, etc. The vulnerability comes in when a remote attacker intercepts the renegotiation and poses as the user.
